          <h2>Hello,</h2>
          <p class="intro">I'm a data analyst who also dabbles in web design. I know, I know, you're thinking "wow, what a wild combination!" But trust me, it's the best of both worlds.
            When I'm not analyzing data or designing websites, you can usually find me doing something silly like attempting to juggle or singing 90s boy band songs at the top of my lungs. Don't worry, I won't subject you to my terrible singing unless you specifically ask for it (and even then, I might have to charge extra).
            If you're looking for a data analyst who can also design a killer website, then look no further! I'm your g. I'm passionate about both fields and love nothing more than helping clients turn their data into something beautiful and useful.
            So what are you waiting for? Get in touch and let's make some magic happen! And who knows, maybe we'll even have a few laughs along the way.</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>I love data analysis, and no, I don't spend all day staring at spreadsheets and trying to decipher cryptic codes. Well, not all day, at least.
               I take all the jumbled up data that a company collects and turn it into something meaningful. It's like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, I'm solving business problems. there are always plenty of data mysteries to unravel!</p>

            <h3>Design and Development</h3>
            <p> I can create a website that's so visually appealing, it'll make your eyes dance! I mean, seriously, it's like a disco party in your retinas!</p>

            <h3>Crocheting</h3>
            <p> First off, picture me, a self-proclaimed crocheting expert, with my trusty hook in hand and a ball of yarn ready to go. I like to think of myself as a yarn magician, creating beautiful masterpieces out of nothing but a strand of string. But in reality, I'm more like a yarn-tangling disaster waiting to happen.</p>

            <h3>Wire work</h3>
            <p>It's like being a mad scientist in a lab, but instead of test tubes and beakers, I've got pliers and wire cutters.
                I spend hours and hours twisting and turning wires into intricate designs that would make even the most talented spider jealous. My hands are like magic, weaving and bending the metal until it takes on a life of its own. So if you ever need a piece of jewelry that will make people go "ooh" and "ahh," just come to me. I'm the wire wizard, and I'll create a masterpiece just for you. </p>
